[University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu)

Date: Tuesday, August 1, 2017<br>
Time: 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm<br>
Location: Zar Room, John Crerar Library<br>
Instructor: Peter Carbonetto
<br>
<br>

## General Information

The [R computing environment](http://cran.r-project.org) has become
one of the most important tools in quantitative research, from
computational biology to financial modeling. This short workshop will
expose participants to the basic elements of R through an analysis of
[Divvy bike trip data](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data). The
aim is to provide participants with the basic tools to explore the
features of R and RStudio on their own, either on the RCC cluster, or
on their own computer.

**Level:** Introductory

**Prerequistes:** Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system that they
have administrative privileges on. An RCC account is helpful, but not
required. No previous programming experience is required.

**Where:** Kathleen A. Zar Room, John Crerar Library, University of
Chicago ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=john%20crerar%20library#map=18/41.79053/-87.60282)).

**Other information:** This workshop is an attempt to apply elements of
the
[Software Carpentry approach](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons).

## Aims

+ Understand why R has become important in many areas of research.

+ Setting up your laptop or your RCC cluster account to do interactive
programming in R.

+ Learn how to install & use R packages.

+ Learn basic elements of R data analysis by example. 

+ Work with "R Markdown" documents.
<br>
<br>

## Outline

During this workshop, we will explore city-wide biking trends by
analyzing the
[Divvy trip data](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data). Also, we
will examine trip data from one bike station at the University of
Chicago.
